This is the repository for removing excess/redundant packages.

NOTE: Removing GNOME packages should be done in the ui-gnome repository.

LMDE requires a DVD and is over 1 GB in size.  Swift Linux needs to be under 700 MB to fit onto a CD.

Go to https://github.com/swiftlinux/z-antix-remove_packages for the old version of this repository.  This will give
you an idea of what to remove.

Other distros to look to for examples of what to keep and what to remove are:
antiX Linux - full version
Puppy Linux
Linux Mint with LXDE
Linux Mint with Fluxbox
